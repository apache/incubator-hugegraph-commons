hugegraph-commons is a common module for [HugeGraph](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph) and its peripheral components.
hugegraph-commons encapsulates locks, configurations, events, iterators, rest and some 
numeric or collection util classes to simplify the development of HugeGraph and its components.

## Components

- Lock: atomic lock, key lock, lock group and lock manger
- Config: register and load config option with security check
- Event: listening and notification, do something asynchronously
- Iterator: some iterators with extra functions, map, filter, extend etc.
- Rest: RESTful client implemented on Jersey, POST, PUT, GET and DELETE
- Util: performance analyzer, version checker, numeric and Collection utils, log and exception utils etc.
- Rpc: rpc component for inner module communication, currently it's based on [Sofa-RPC](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc)
